<div class="badge">WHOOPS. I'm still making my website, and this page hasn't been finished yet. Sorry!</div>

<div class="center">
  <p>The electrical in these blueprints is for testing purposes, not for a full fusor. The power supply will be swapped for a higher voltage supply once the system is verified to hold vacuum and produce plasma.</p>

  <p>Change of plans. I ended up buying this used conflat 2.75" cross from someone on fusor.net I will use this as my vacuum chamber now instead of the KF50 I originally bought. The KF50 will still be used, possibly to add more gauges in the future. I will be drawing up an updated blueprint sheet at some point to reflect this change. </p>

  <p>This project is still underway. On the to-do list is several items: I need to clean up and test the vacuum gauge, get all the components attached properly, and then source a power supply to start testing the setup.</p>
